# Calculator Problem Statement

## Overview

- Design a console-based calculator program in C that accepts mathematical expressions as input in the form of strings.
- The program should evaluate the expression and return the result. Supported operations include addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
- The program should handle integer operations and output the result as an integer, even if the result of division has a remainder.

## Requirements

- The input should be a mathematical expression in the form of a string.
- The input string contains integers and operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) only.
- The program should handle whitespace between numbers and operators, which should be ignored.
- The program should output the result of the expression as an integer.
- If division by zero occurs, the program should display an error message: `Error: Division by zero.`
- If the input expression is invalid (e.g., contains invalid characters), the program should display an error message: `Error: Invalid expression.`
- The program should follow the order of operations (DMAS), where multiplication and division are performed before addition and subtraction.
- Consider handling precedence and associativity while evaluating the expression.

## Input Format

- The input will consist of a single line containing the mathematical expression as a string.

## Output Format

- The output will be a single integer or an error message depending on the evaluation result.

## Test Cases

### Test Case 1

**Input**:  
`"3 + 5 * 2"`

**Output**:  
`13`

### Test Case 2

**Input**:  
`"3 + a * 2"`

**Output**:  
`Error: Invalid expression.`
