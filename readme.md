# Problem Statement

Write a program in **C** to read a 2D array of strings where each element represents a student's name. The program should then:

1. **Print the names in a matrix format.**
2. **Count and display the number of names that start with a vowel** (`a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u`).
3. **Display the longest name** in the 2D array.

## Input

- **Number of rows (R)**: An integer, \( 1 \leq R \leq 10 \).
- **Number of columns (C)**: An integer, \( 1 \leq C \leq 10 \).
- **Names in the 2D array**: Each name is a string with a maximum length of 50 characters.

## Output

1. The 2D array of names in matrix format.
2. The count of names starting with a vowel.
3. The longest name in the array.

## Requirements

1. The program should handle input and output in a **user-friendly manner**.
2. Ensure **proper input validation** (e.g., the number of rows and columns should be within the given constraints).
3. Write **clean and well-documented code** for clarity.
