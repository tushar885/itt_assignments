# Queue Implementation Using Array

## Description

This program demonstrates the implementation of a **Queue** using an array in C. It includes basic queue operations such as **enqueue**, **dequeue**, **peek**, **isEmpty**, and **size**. A queue is a linear data structure that follows the **First In First Out (FIFO)** principle.

## Operations:

The following operations are implemented in the queue:

1. **enqueue**: Adds an element to the rear of the queue.

   - **Time Complexity**: O(1)
   - **Space Complexity**: O(1)

2. **dequeue**: Removes the front element from the queue.

   - **Time Complexity**: O(1)
   - **Space Complexity**: O(1)

3. **peek**: Retrieves the front element without removing it.

   - **Time Complexity**: O(1)
   - **Space Complexity**: O(1)

4. **isEmpty**: Checks if the queue is empty.

   - **Time Complexity**: O(1)
   - **Space Complexity**: O(1)

5. **size**: Returns the number of elements currently in the queue.
   - **Time Complexity**: O(1)
   - **Space Complexity**: O(1)

## Example Usage:

1. **enqueue**: Add an element to the queue.
2. **dequeue**: Remove an element from the front of the queue.
3. **peek**: Check the front element without removing it.
4. **isEmpty**: Check if the queue is empty.
5. **size**: Get the number of elements in the queue.

This queue implementation uses an array of size 100 to store the elements, and it tracks the **front** and **rear** indices to manage the queue operations.
