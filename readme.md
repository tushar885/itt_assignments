## Problem: Substring Search in Array of Strings

### Problem Description:

You are given an array of strings and another string as input. Your task is to print all the strings from the array that contain the given string as a **substring**.

### Input:

- An integer `n` representing the number of strings in the array.
- An array of `n` strings, each string containing only lowercase alphabets.
- A string `target` (also containing lowercase alphabets) that you need to check as a substring.

### Output:

- Print all the strings from the array that contain the `target` string as a substring.
- If no string in the array contains the `target` string as a substring, print "No match found."

### Constraints:

- `1 ≤ n ≤ 1000`
- `1 ≤ length of each string ≤ 50`
